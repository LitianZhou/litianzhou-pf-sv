# Litian-Pf-SV  
## Introduction

This is the final report for my ten-week internship.

There are two parts of this report. The technical part and the biological part.

The **technical part** named `technical_report.Rmd` includes pipelines and R code for analysis.

The **biological part** named `Pf_SVs_detection.Rmd` includes promising structural variants and their overlaps with genes.

Both parts are written in RMarkdown, you can view my code directly in Github. To reduce the distraction, you can also download the HTML or doc files which have neat arrangement. (You need to download the entire directory and view HTML files from local, sorry for the inconvinence!)

#### At last, I am so glad to work with all of my labmates from both Bahlo lab and Barry lab. Thanks everyone for their great patience and knowledge.  

#### Best wishes to WEHI!!
