# Introduction

This is the report of my work during my ten-week internship.

There are two parts of this report. The technical part and the biological part.

The **technical part** includes pipelines and R code for analysis.

The **biological part** includes promising structural variants and their overlaps with genes.

Both parts are written in RMarkdown. You need to download the whole repository to knit (in RStudio) them. Or you can download the doc files which have identical contents.

I am glad to work with all of you. Thanks everyone and best wishes to WEHI!!
